In the Movie "Spirited Away" by Hayao Miyazaki, No-Face is a spirit with a strange obsession with Chihiro.

## What is enlightenment
Explain stages of enlightenmnet

## The Ocean Surrounding the Bath House
I believe the the sea that surrounds the bath house is a methaphor for the challanges required to achieve enlightenment.
The bath house's workers are not enlightened.
When No-Face showers the workers with fake gold, they are quick to do his bidding.
The workers are unable to give up physical wealth, which is turn shows they are beholden to their own desires.
I believe the bath house employees have not yet set out on their quest to enlightenment.

The next stage of enlightenment is displayed by the Souls riding on the Deep-Sea Railway (海原電鉄).
Although these souls no longer have bodies, they are scene carrying around clothing and luggage. This shows
that these souls have not yet given up personal items. The Spirits also take the figure of office workers. This
is a job where rank means everything, a higher rank equals a higher salary. The desire to attain a higher rank
is a desire that is in contradiction to obtaining enlightenment.
I believe the spirits departed at the station to be reborn in the human world.
There is also a spirit of a young girl on the platform.
Because she is so young, she likely did not have enough time to enlighten herself before her death, and therefore must be reborn.

Zeniba represents the third stage of enlightened. Similar to the Spirits on the train, she has a physical body
and items. The difference with Zeniba is that she creates what she needs herself.
Even her body is likely created by her own magic.
Chihiro's and ours confusion between Zeniba and her sister Yubaba show that she has dropped attachment to self.

The final stage is represented by the other side of the ocean.
I believe the train's final stop is at the end of the ocean.
When Chihiro enters the spirit realm, we see Gods leaving a ferry that arrived on the bath house island.
I believe that these gods are fully enlightended.
This can be seen by their lack of physical form.
It comes to reason, that the place they are coming from is where the fully enlightened Gods live, which is the same place
that the final stop of the train is at.

## No-Faces Journey
No-Faces journey starts from the bath house and ends at Zeniba's place. I do not think that No-Face achieves enlightenment
during the movie, we only see his first few steps after being reborn in the realm of gods.
No-Face is surrounded by greed at the beginning of the movie, and is infactuated by Chihiro the  first moment he sees her.
I belive this is because Chihiro is a pure soul.
Unlike the other characters on the bath house island, she can not be swayed by No-Face's fake gold.

When no-face first enters the bath house as a customer, he gives out fake gold to the staff to get everything he wants.

When Chihiro feeds No-Face a bitter dango (苦団子), No-Face is forced to vomit everything up he took from the bath house.
At first No-Face is angry and violent. He chases after Chihiro in anger.
But once No-Face vomits up everything, his demeanor changes.
No-Face no longer holds anger, and in-fact calmly sits next to Chihiro on the train to Zeniba's house.
I believe this shows No-Face realized he did not need things to be happy.

I have been working as a computer science TA for the last two semesters. My job is to give student's
homework a prelimiary grade to save time for the prefessors. Currently that means I am grading about
20 C++ projects per weak. I noticed that most students make the same code mistakes that can be easily
fixed.

This blog post will go over common beginner errors and how to fix them.

## Style Issues

Beginner programmers make many of the same style mistakes with their code. In this section, I will go over
a few common ones with easy fixes.

### Too much whitespace

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    function main() {

    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b


    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    function main() {
    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

Many students submit assignments with whitespace at the beginning and end of functions and other blocks.
The fix is to start and end each function with a line of code.

### Incorrect Whitespace Amount at The Start Of Lines

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    function main() {
  	let a = 5
  	let b = 10
  	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    function main() {
    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

A common mistake is placing too many or too little tabs at the beginning on a line.
Make sure that all code follows the C++ language standard. This is important to make sure
all readers understand your code with the least amount of friction possible.

### Inconsistent Whitespace

### Line Breaks after If-Statements

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    if (a == b) {
      console.log("a == b!")
    }

    else {
      console.log("a != b")
    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    if (a == b) {
      console.log("a == b!")
    } else {
      console.log("a != b")
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

## "Programmatic Issues"

# IO too deep

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    function add(): int {
      let a = input("a:")
      let b = input("b:")

      return a + b
    }

    function main() {
      print(add())
    }

    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    function add(a: int, b: int): int {
      return a + b
    }

    function main() {
      let a = input("a:")
      let b = input("b:")

      print(add(a, b))
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

I see a lot of studnets placing their IO functions in a called function instead of the
main function. In this example, I show an incorrect function that asks the user for an
input. This makes the function more difficult to understand and to test.

By moving asking the user for an input to the main function we have two advangaes:

	- The function `add` does exactly what the title name says
	- We can now test `add` without needing to worry about the asking for an input step.

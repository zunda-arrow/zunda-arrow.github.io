I have been working as a computer science TA for the last two semesters. My job is to give student's
homework a prelimiary grade to save time for the prefessors. Currently that means I am grading about
25 C++ per weak. I noticed that most students make the same code formatting mistakes that can be easily
fixed.

This blog post will go over common beginner errors and how to fix them.

- Too much whitespace
- Extra tabs
- Line breaks after if
- Return is in the wrong paragraph
- IO too deep in program
- Not using guards
- Unnecisary copies


## Too much whitespace

Many students submit assignments with whitespace at the begginning and end of functions and other blocks.

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    function main() {

    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b


    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    function main() {
    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

## Incorrect Tabs

A common mistake is placing too many or too little tabs at the beginning on a line.

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    function main() {
  	let a = 5
  	let b = 10
  	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    function main() {
    	let a = 5
    	let b = 10
    	return a + b
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

## Line Breaks after If-Statements

<Tab client:idle>
		<div slot="Incorrect">
    ```ts
    if (a == b) {
      console.log("a == b!")
    }

    else {
      console.log("a != b")
    }
    ```
		</div>

		<div slot="Correct">
    ```ts
    if (a == b) {
      console.log("a == b!")
    } else {
      console.log("a != b")
    }
    ```
		</div>
</Tab>

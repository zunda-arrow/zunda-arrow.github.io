# About Me
Hello, I'm Jacob Haussman. I am a Computer Science Major with a Minor in Japanese and Theoretical Mathematics.
I prefer my code to be functionally terrible than inherently bad. My favorite food is Spaghetti and Meatballs.

I host my code on [Github](https://github.com/lunarmagpie).

## Contact Me
My preferred method of contact is email. Please email me at [jacob.haussman@gmail.com](mailto:jacob.haussman@gmail.com).
If you would like file a bug with one of my project, I would prefer if you create a issue on github!
